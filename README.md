<p align="center">Hello! This was a project developed as a team for Porto Digital's Onboard Residency with the theme "The bridges that sports build". In this Kick Off phase, we were asked to idealize a product - with persona, CSD matrix, user journey, etc - and a navigable prototype.</p>

## About üìù
<p align="justify">Run & Raid is a gamified running mobile application, where you can exercise while having fun. The gamification is done by counting points after defeating bosses and completing paths. Points can be exchanged for customizable items for your character. In addition to the score, there is also a system of badges and titles, which you can unlock according to your performance in the game.</p>
